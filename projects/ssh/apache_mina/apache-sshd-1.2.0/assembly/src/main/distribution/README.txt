Welcome to Apache SSHD

Apache SSHD is a library to support the SSH2 protocol on both
client and server side in java.

This distribution provides a simple demonstration of a SSH
server and client that you can launched using the shell scripts in the
bin folder.  By default, the port used is 8000 and the authentication
will succeed if the username and password are the same.
SCP and SFTP support are both enabled in this configuration.

The lib folder contains the sshd-core jar which is the main jar
and its required dependencies.

Please send feedback to users@mina.apache.org.
