Orchid
======

Orchid is a Tor client implementation and library written in pure Java.  Orchid's strength is that it can be used to Tor-ify Java and JVM applications with near transparency.

It was written from the Tor specification documents, which are available [here](https://www.torproject.org/docs/documentation.html.en#DesignDoc).

Orchid runs on Java 5+ and the Android devices.

## How can Orchid be used?

Orchid can be used as a standalone client where [the canonical Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) would otherwise be used.  Orchid acts as a SOCKS5 proxy.

Orchid can also be used as a library by any application running on the JVM. This is what Orchid was really designed for and this is the recommended way to use it. Orchid can be used as a library in any Java application, or any application written in a language that compiles bytecode that will run on the Java virtual machine, e.g. JRuby, Clojure, Scala...

## How to build

Now Orchid uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as its build system.  Currently tested with both Java 10 and 11 on Debian sid (openjdk-10-jdk / openjdk-11-jdk).

```
gradle build
```

will produce a JAR in `build/libs` directory.

```
gradle fatJar
```

will produce a fat JAR, which contains both classes and dependencies needed to run Orchid as a standalone client.

You may find prebuilt JARs in [Releases](https://github.com/mhatta/Orchid/releases).

The old Ant build system is still available, but works with Java 8 only.

## How to run

To start the Orchid SOCKS5 proxy, perform the following:

```
java -jar Orchid-v1.0.5.jar
```

To test Orchid, you can tell your web browser to use Orchid as a SOCKS5 proxy (the default listening port is `9150`) - however it is important to note that Orchid + your browser is **NOT** a secure replacement for [the Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.htm), which has many other enhancements beyond Tor.

For example, with Mozilla Firefox, by default, DNS lookups are not sent over a configured SOCKS5 proxy. You can change this potentially de-anonymizing default configuration by going to the URL `about:config` and setting the property `network.proxy.socks_remote_dns` to `true` (this is already done in the Tor Browser).

## Using the dashboard

Orchid also includes a "dashboard" feature to observe information about the internal state of Tor. To start the dashboard, set the following property when the JAR is run like:

```
java -Dcom.subgraph.orchid.dashboard.port=10000 -jar Orchid-v1.0.5.jar
```

To access the dashboard, just connect to the port (for this example `10000`) with netcat.

## How to use as a library

The Orchid Tor client exposes a SocketFactory that can be used within a JVM application. More detailed documentation and code examples are coming very soon.  [This Stack Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29171643/java-tor-lib-how-to-setup-orchid-tor-lib-with-java) might be helpful for now.

## Authors

Orchid was originally developed by [Bruce Leidl](https://github.com/brl) of [Subgraph](https://subgraph.com/).  The original web page can be found [here](https://subgraph.com/orchid/).  This README borrows heavily from there.

## Demo

A typical Orchid run will output something like this:

```

There will be a lot of `INFO - CircuitCreationTask - Cannot build circuits because we don't have enough directory information` warnings and pauses during the session.  It is usually OK, be patient.  The first time run will take much longer time than the sessions hereafter.
